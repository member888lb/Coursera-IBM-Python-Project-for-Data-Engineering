ETL Lab Practice
There are two lab projects: 
1) Datasette of individual's name, height and weight from 3 different source file formats (.csv, .json and .xml).  
2) Datasette of used car prices using headers "Model", "Year", "Price" and "Fuel" from 3 different source file formats (.csv, .json and .xml).
