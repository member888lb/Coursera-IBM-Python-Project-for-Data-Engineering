Objectives
1. Create a database using Python
2. Load the data from a CSV file as a table to the database
3. Run basic "queries" on the database to access the information

Scenario
Consider a dataset of employee records that is available with an HR team in a CSV file. As a Data Engineer, you are required to create the database called STAFF and load the contents of the CSV file as a table called INSTRUCTORS. The headers (attribute details) of the available data are:

ID	Employee ID
FNAME	First Name
LNAME	Last Name
CITY	City of residence
CCODE	Country code (2 letters)

Tasks:
1. Connect to the SQLite3 service
2. Define table parameters
3. Read the CSV data
4. Load the CSV to the database
5. Close Connection (after query and append scripts)

Query:
1. Display all rows of the table
2. Display only the FNAME column for the full table.
3. Display the count of the total number of rows.

Append:
1. Define data to be appended
2. Append data to the table

After Append Query:
1. Display the count of the total number of rows.
